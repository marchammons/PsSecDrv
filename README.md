# How to install SECDRV.sys to play games
Microsoft does provide a way to re-enable SECDRV.

* Install a game that brings (a recent version of) `SECDRV.sys`.
* Install the Windows 10 SDK from [Get the standalone Windows 10 SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk).  
Just install all components.
* Find `makecat.exe`, `makecert.exe` and `signtool.exe` and add the path to your PATH in System Properties, Environment Variables.  
The ones in a x86 subfolder are always OK on all Intel architecture chips. No need to match the hardware or the OS bitness.  
  ```
  $SdkToolsPath = dir -Path "${env:ProgramFiles(x86)}\Windows Kits\10" -Recurse -Directory | where { $n = $_.FullName; $_.BaseName -eq "x86" -and [System.IO.File]::Exists("$n\makecert.exe") -and [System.IO.File]::Exists("$n\makecat.exe") -and [System.IO.File]::Exists("$n\signtool.exe") } | sort CreationTime | select -Last 1
  $env:Path = "$env:Path;$($SdkToolsPath.FullName)"
  ```
* Create a new folder in your Downloads folder
  ```
  $WorkingDirectory = "$env:UserProfile\Downloads\SECDRV"
  if (-not (Test-Path $WorkingDirectory)) { mkdir $WorkingDirectory | Out-Null }
  ```
* Run all further commands in a PowerShell prompt as Administrator in the folder you created.
  ```
  cd $WorkingDirectory
  ```
* Copy `SECDRV.sys` in it. If it's an old version, replace it with this one downloadable [here](https://github.com/ericwj/PsSecDrv/raw/master/tools/SECDRV/SECDRV.sys). Its from September 2006.
  ```
  # Using curl (Windows 10 has it inbox)
  curl.exe -OL https://github.com/ericwj/PsSecDrv/raw/master/tools/SECDRV/SECDRV.sys
  # Using PowerShell or PowerShell Core
  iwr -Uri https://github.com/ericwj/PsSecDrv/raw/master/tools/SECDRV/SECDRV.sys -OutFile SECDRV.sys
  ```
* Enable test signing boot mode.  
  ```
  bcdedit /set "{current}" testsigning on
  ```
* Pick a subject - any subject, but include the text "SECDRV" in it
  ```
  $Subject = "SECDRV.sys Publisher by \\$env:ComputerName\$env:UserName on $("{0:yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm}" -f [datetimeoffset]::Now)"
  ```
* Create a root certificate.  
  ```
  makecert -r -sr LocalMachine -ss My -n CN=$Subject
  ```
* Open Local Machine Certificates.  
  ```
  certlm.msc
  ```
* Go to Personal, Certificates and select the certificate created, there usually is only one, or match the subject, right click Copy.
* Go to Trusted Root Certification Authorities, Certificates. Paste.
* Go to Trusted Publishers, Certificates. Paste.
* Make a text file called `SECDRV.cdf` in the folder and put the text between @" and "@ in it.
  ```
  sc -Path SECDRV.cdf -Value @"
  [CatalogHeader]
  Name=SECDRV.cat
  PublicVersion=0x1
  EncodingType=0x00010001
  CATATTR1=0x10010001:OSAttr:2:6.0
  [CatalogFiles]
  <hash>SECDRV=SECDRV.sys
  "@
  ```
* Make a driver catalog file in the folder.  
  ```
  makecat -o SECDRV.txt -r SECDRV.cdf
  ```
* Get the thumbprint of the certificate you created. The thumbprint is shown in certlm for the certificate created, just double click it and look around, without spaces. Or get it in PowerShell with dir:
  ```PS
  $Publishers = dir Cert:\LocalMachine -Recurse | where Subject -Match SECDRV | sort NotAfter
  $Publishers | select Thumbprint, NotBefore, NotAfter, Subject
  $Publisher = $Publishers | select -Last 1
  ```
* Sign the driver.  
  ```
  signtool sign /sm /s Root /sha1 "$($Publisher.Thumbprint)" /t "http://timestamp.verisign.com/scripts/timstamp.dll" secdrv.cat
  ```
* Install the driver.
  ```
  signtool catdb /u secdrv.cat
  ```
* Reboot.
* Test if it works.
  ```
  & cmd /c sc start secdrv # In PowerShell
  ```

If it doesn't work, check these reasons.
* You are not an Administrator or you opened the PowerShell prompt without elevation. Right click the button in the Task Bar and hit *Run as Administrator* and start over.
* `SECDRV.sys` on your system is too old. Then the driver doesn't start. Right click it, hit *Properties*, go to *Details* and check *Product version*. It contains a date as a string. If you downloaded it from the link above, the version is "SECURITY Driver 4.03.086 2006/09/13".
* Secure Boot is enabled. Run bcdedit again after disabling it.
* You didn't reboot. You will have to reboot.

Now play games.
